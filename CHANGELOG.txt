===================================
TSDuck Change Log and Release Notes
===================================

Version 3.12-770

- Added plugin "merge" which merges two transport streams.

- Added option --realtime to "tsp". This option selects appropriate default
  options when operating on real-time streamings. The "default defaults" remain
  appropriate for offline processing, such as working on transport streams files.
  This option is also automatically set by some plugins which are designed for
  real-time streaming ("dvb", "ip", dektec", "play", "regulate", "mpeinject").

- Added options --log-protocol and --log-data to "tsecmg", "tsemmg" and plugins
  "scrambler", "datainject".

- Added options --udp and --unregulated to plugin "datainject".

- Many more descriptors are supported. See the user's guide.

- On Windows, portable packages are now built for users without admin privilege.

- Bug fix: If an XML representation of a splice information table contained a
  splice_insert command, the <break_duration> structure was rejected when the
  event was marked as immediate.

- Bug fix: In "tsemmg", the TCP disconnection of the MUX was not detected in a
  timely fashion when data was injected using UDP.

- Bug fix: In "tsemmg", sending UDP data to a broadcast address was not allowed.
  Now it is possible to send data to a local broadcast address. Using routed
  broadcast remains not possible (because this is usually not a good thing to
  route broadcast).

- Regression fix: In plugin "datainject", the section mode was no longer handled
  correctly since version 3.10.

Version 3.11-715

- Added plugin "spliceinject" to inject SCTE 35 splice information in real time.

- Added options --sync-layout, --dump-datagram, --dump-udp, --dump-max and
  --skip to plugin "mpe".

- Added utility "tsemmg", an EMMG simulator for MUX integration testing.

- Added option --buffer-size in plugin "datainject". The plugin is now able to
  receive data using UDP, as defined in the DVB SimulCrypt protocol.

- SCTE 35 splice information tables can now be created from XML format.

- Bug fix: In "tstables" and plugin "tables", with options --xml and
  --max-tables, the XML structure was not properly closed.

- Bug fix: Application Information Tables (AIT) were not correctly serialized.

- Bug fix: In rare cases, time conversions could produce incorrect results when
  the time value was in the middle of the "non-existing hour", during the
  spring switch of daylight saving time. In practice, the problem occured on
  Linux when handling the "next change time" of a TOT and the system local
  time was UTC.

Version 3.10-672

- The utility "tstabdump" can now dump sections and files which are sent over
  UDP/IP by "tstables" or the plugin "tables". Command line options were added
  to specify UDP parameters (same UDP reception options as input plugin "ip").

- Added options --fix and --pid to plugin "continuity".

- Added option --after-packets to plugin "filter".

- Added options --default-interface to input plugin "ip" and plugin "mpeinject".

- Added options --inter-time, --max-insert-count, --min-pts, --max-pts and
  --pts-pid to plugin "mux".

- Added option --milli-seconds to plugin "history".

- Input plugin "file" can now read more than one file. Input files are
  concatenated as input stream.

- Added option --fifo-size to output plugin "dektec".

- Added option --atis-idsa to plugins "scrambler" and "descrambler" (perform
  ATIS-IDSA scrambling instead of DVB-CSA2).

- Added utility "tsecmg", a DVB SimulCrypt-compliant ECMG stub to test system
  integration. The plugin "descrambler" has been enhanced to decode the "fake"
  ECM's which are generated by "tsecmg".

- Added option --integer to tsversion (useful to check a version in a script).

- Bug fix: Incorrect behaviour on Linux and macOS when receiving multicast with
  plugins "ip" and "mpeinject" and a --local-interface was specified.

- Bug fix: "tsanalyze" and a few plugins could crash when a video PID contained
  corrupted AVC/H.264 video (or incorrect video data which looked like H.264).

- Bug fix: Plugin "analyze" with option --interval incorrectly used the TS
  clock to produce the analysis files instead of the wall clock time.

- Bug fix: Plugin "history": Detection of scrambling transitions: Now ignore
  packets without payload or with short payloads (less than 8 bytes). These
  packets are normally left clear in a scrambled PID. Considering them as clear
  packets used to report spurious scrambled-to-clear transitions, immediately
  followed by clear-to-scrambled transistions.

Version 3.9-619

- Added plugins mpe and mpeinject to respectively extract and inject MPE
  (Multi-Protocol Encapsulation) datagrams to/from UDP/IP. A complete example
  is provided in the user's guide.

- Added options --add-start-stuffing and --add-stop-stuffing to tsp.

- Added options --sei-avc and --uuid-sei to plugin pes.

- Added options --add-programinfo-id, --set-stream-identifier, --set-cue-type
  and --set-data-broadcast-id to plugin pmt.

- Added option --identify to plugin t2mi.

- Added options --all-once, --pack-all-sections and --pack-and-flush to tstables
  and plugin tables.

- Added option --default-charset to tsanalyze and plugin analyze.

- Added signalization for data broadcast and MPE.

- Improved display of Dektec devices capabilities.

- In all TSDuck commands, parameters can be read from a file using the syntax
  "@filename" anywhere in the command line. See the user's guide for details.

- Bug fix in tstables and plugin tables: When all sections were collected
  (option --all), the sections were not properly saved in binary section files
  (option --binary).

- Bug fix on Windows: Command "tsversion --upgrade" failed because tsversion.exe
  and tsduck.dll were locked by upgrade command.

- Bug fix on Linux: With DVB-T tuners which do not support "auto bandwidth"
  (PCTV 492e for instance), tscan failed to scan the UHF band.

- Added possibility to specify a GitHub authentication token in tsversion to
  avoid "API rate limit exceeded" errors.

- Precompiled binaries are now provided for Raspbian on Raspberry Pi.

Version 3.8-534

- Added options --source and --first-source to input plugin ip.

- Added option --periodic-bitrate to plugin bitrate_monitor.

- Added options --pid, --csv and --log to plugin pcrextract.

- Added XML support for more DVB and EACEM descriptors.

- When the output plugin "play" uses VLC, the player exits automatically at the
  end of the video playout.

- On macOS, the output plugin "play" now correctly detects VLC in its original
  installation path.

- Bug fix in the compilation of XML tables: when DVB strings were encoded with
  a character set different from ISO-6937 (the default character set), the
  table code was not correctly inserted at the beginning of the string.

- Bug fix in plugin bitrate_monitor. The message was incorrect when the bitrate
  is *greater* then the limit (the message was ok in other cases).

- Bug fix in plugin rmsplice. With option --adjust time, the time stamps were
  not correctly adjusted.

Version 3.7-512

- Added plugin teletext to extract Teletext subtitles in SRT format.

- Added plugin rmsplice to remove ads insertions when signaled using SCTE 35
  splice information.

- Added option --add-ca-descriptor to plugin pmt.

- More details are displayed in SCTE 35 splice information.

- The command tsp --list is now paged, like option --help.

- Bug fix in tstables and plugin tables: with XML output, option --time-stamp
  was ineffective and option --packet-index was always on.

- Bug fix in plugin pcrextract: options --pts and --dts were reversed.

Version 3.6-491

- Added options --synchronous-log and --log-message-count to tsp. They affect
  the way log messages are dropped or displayed in case a vast amount of log
  messages are produced in a short period of time.

- Added option --plp to tsscan and plugin dvb. Used to select the DVB-T2 PLP.
  This option is unsupported on Windows.

- Added options --output-file, --append and --keep to plugin t2mi.

- Added HEVC signalization.

- Added SCTE 35 signalization (splice information for ads insertion).

- Fixed input plugin ip: When multiple multicast streams are sent to the same
  UDP port (although with different addresses), make sure we receive only the
  requested stream. Previously, in some system configurations, the input plugin
  ip could receive packets from distinct multicast streams.

- Various fixes about UDP on macOS (multicast reception, --reuse-port options).

- The help text of all TSDuck applications (using option --help) is now paged
  through "less" or any any other pager application.

- Added the utility tsversion to manage TSDuck versions, detect new versions,
  upgrade, etc.

Version 3.5-414

- Added option --xml-output to tstables and plugin tables. Tables can be saved
  directly in XML format. It is no longer necessary to save in binary and then
  use the decompiler to rebuild XML files.

- With tstables and plugin tables, it is possible to specify several formats
  at the same time. For instance, it is possible to save tables in text, XML
  and binary format at the same time.

- With tspacketize and plugin inject, it is now possible to load tables in XML
  format. The options --binary and --xml have been added to specify the file
  type if its name is neither .bin nor .xml. It is no longer necessary to use
  the compiler to rebuild binary section files.

- Added option --byte to tsftrunc.

- The options --verbose and --debug have been generalized to all commands.

- For programmers, the TSDuck library API was extensively modified. All usage
  of 8-bit strings (char* and std::string) has been removed and replaced by
  Java-like Unicode strings (ts::UString). Many interface have been updated.
  The utilities in tsStringUtils have been removed. Equivalent services exist
  in class ts::UString. All of this break the backward compatibility of user
  code. This is unfortunate but TSDuck code is now more robust and faster to
  maintain.

- The "revision" number is no longer a "build date" but a "commit count".
  With a build date, there was a risk that two identical sets of sources had
  different revision numbers and that that two different sets of sources had
  identical revision numbers. The new "commit count" which is automatically
  generated by git is a global commit count of all branches and is always
  increased. It represents a set of commited sources. Moreover, each object
  file contains the revision number at the time of compilation. The downside
  is that each commit forces a recompilation of everything since the revision
  is automatically increased.

Version 3.4-20171110

- TSDuck now fully handles DVB character sets in signalization. All textual
  display (tsanalyze, tstables, etc.) are produced in UTF-8 format, with
  characters properly translated from DVB character encoding. The table
  compiler, tstabcomp, properly translates from UTF-8 XML files to DVB
  character encoding and vice versa.

- Added options --default-charset and --europe to tspsi, tstables, tstabdump,
  tstabcomp, plugin psi and plugin tables.

- Added t2mi plugin to extract encapsulated TS packets from T2-MI streams
  (DVB-T2 Modulator Interface).

- T2-MI PID's and PLP's are now included in the report from tsanalyze and the
  plugin analyze.

- Improved robustness of DVB tuner detection on Windows. It solves some issues
  with 32-bit tuner filters on 64-bit systems. But older systems, before
  Windows 7 (XP, Vista, etc.), may no longer work. No support will be provided
  for pre-7 Windows systems.

- Added --test option to tslsdvb on Windows.

Version 3.3-20170930

- Added option --default-pds to tspsi, tstables, tstabdump, plugin psi
  and plugin tables.

- Added option --interval to plugin count.

- Fixed timer issues on Linux, typically seen in plugin regulate.

- Removed command tsgentab and associated plugins. This command is now
  obsolete and has been superseded by the more general tstabcomp, the
  PSI/SI table compiler.

Version 3.3-20170915

- Added command tstabcomp, the PSI/SI table compiler from/to XML files.
  The command tsgentab is now deprecated and will be removed in some
  future version.

Version 3.2-20170911

- Added option --pid to plugin descrambler.

- Improved robustness of option --poll-file ('inject' plugin). Mitigate
  possible race condition when the plugin tries to open a section file
  while it is created/copied by the user. Now retry later.

- Improved robustness of DVB tuner reception on Windows. Explicitly
  resynchronizes on valid packets when the driver misses data.

- Adjusted output of tslsdvb on Windows to better identify tuner names.

- Integrated Dektec DTAPI v5.27.0.97 (Dektec SDK v2017.08.0) on pre-built
  binaries for Windows and Linux.

Version 3.2-20170528

- Added option --poll-file to inject plugin.

- Bug fix: In tstables and tables plugin, the option --max-tables was not
  accurate when several small tables (eg. EMM's) were packed in the same
  TS packet. This is fixed.

Version 3.2-20170525

- Added the development environment in the Windows Installer. This is used to
  develop third-party applications using the TSDuck library. On Ubuntu, added
  the tsduck-dev package. On RPM-based distros, the tsduck-devel package
  already existed.

- Added option --no-duplicate to tstables and tables plugin.

- Added TSPLUGINS_PATH environment variable to use tsp and tsgentab plugins
  outside the directory of the TSDuck executables.
